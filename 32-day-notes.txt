Bastion/Jump Host
------------------------
We will create one EC2 instance in public subnet, Bastion host

Allow backend servers and DB servers to connect from bastion host

user --> bastion host --> RDS, Backend servers

Public --> PR officer --> PMO office

Snapshot
-------------------------
when you delete RDS, it will automatically snapshot for safety before delete.

snapshot is attached to VPC.

You cant delete VPC, because it has the dependency resource of snapshot

db_host = expense-dev.czn6yzxlcsiv.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
