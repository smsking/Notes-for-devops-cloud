What is DevOps?

What is computer?
	Laptop/Desktop/Mobile/Server == Computing Device
	
	Processor
	Ram
	Storage
	OS = Graphics + Kernel = Linux not windows
	Why servers will not have graphics

Laptop/Desktop = Internet surfing + Development + Songs + movies = daily use
Mobile = Apps + Internet + calling
Server = to server the application

more graphics = more memory + more power + more time

Server = less memory + less power + less AC + less time + less cost

Client and Server
-------------------
in or internet world, everything is a computer

we have a Lawyer , we are clients for him

legal service, so we are clients

who gives info = service provider
who requests info = client

laptop = client
server = facebook

laptop = client
mobile = server

mobile = client
laptop = server

What is DevOps?
------------------------

before independence
--------------------
stakeholders --> who are part of system
school = students, parents, teachers

ideally 100% students should get pass

only one final exam 50 years back

student = he will not study from DAY-1
teachers = teachers may not focus to complete syllabus from DAY-1
parents = they always worried about their children from DAY-1

clients == parents

pass percentage was very less

30 years back
--------------------
unit-I, unit-II, quarterly, unit-III, Half yearly, unit-IV, grand test and final test

student = student may start study JUL 1st week
teachers = teachers will start focus on lessons
parents = they will wait until JUL 3rd week

everybody will analyse results.

100 --> 30 members got 31%, 69%

unit-II --> 72%
III --> 75%
Final --> 95%

15 year back
-------------------
daily slip tests

DAY-1 we teach something
DAY-2 we will conduct exam, max 5 questions

students = they start studying from DAY-1
teachers =  they start teaching from DAY-1
parents = they can see results from DAY-1

99.99%

process improvement is the key for best results

whatsapp --> 2011
whatsapp --> 2024

process improvement happened in whatsapp system...

SDLC --> Software Development Lifecycle
Requirements gathering --> what our customers want
Analysis --> Analyse the requirements
Design --> Start designing the project, customers will accept the designing
Develop/implementation --> Implement the designing
Deployment
Test --> Test the design and everything
Maintainance --> 

Waterfall --> water is falling to down
Construction is over --> but testing is failed, output is not as per the design
Demolish the house, start again

50% construction is over --> now customer wants some change in design

disadvantages
---------------
it can't accomodate new requirements
final product output is only at the end

IT--> Waterfall
----------------
students = developers
parents = clients
teachers = testing team

developers, testers, clients

2 or 3 years

developers = no development from DAY-1
testers = no testing from DAY-1
clients = worried

after 1 year they start serious development

few employees will resign, new employees will come = KT

started development

testing what to do? reading 100's of pages from client requirement and planning test cases...

development is completed in DEV env, developers tesed it is good

testing environment --> under pressure. raise more and more defects

started fights between developers and testers

100 defects --> 80 defects valid, 20 defects invalid

lot of emails between developers and testers..involving team leaders.. involving managers .. account head

clients == Ferrari == Maruthi 800


Agile
----------------------
start with small things --> keep short goals
divide the system into small modules
signup and login
product catalogue
cart
payment
delivery

sprints and modules

Sprint-1 may be for 1 month
--------------------------
signup and login

developers = they start from DAY-1 = 1.5 week for development
testers = 1.5 week for testing
1 week for deployment

1.5 weeks = developers conc is more
testers = focus is less

10 defects --> 8 valid, 2 invalid

again same fight

90% completed, 10% pending

Sprint-2 product catalogue
---------------------------
10% backlog


Sprint-final
---------------------------
ferrari == Honda City


2016 --> too much load on servers
----------------------------
daily slip test = daily testing

Sprint-1 = process improvement
------------------------------
DAY-1 he developed a code for

Enter your First Name

DAY-1 ask testing team to test this small code

positive and negative

1. enter the name in 20 char
2. enter the numbers in the name field

10 test cases --> 

DAY-2 ==> no chance of raising invalid defects. 3 valid defects.
Developers and testers will communicate


if the code developed is built and tested on the same day then you can call it as DevOps ==> We use tools to make it fast and reliable

1. Faster releases to the market
2. Less defects

amazon vs flipkart
-------------------
every 11.2sec they do one release, fully automated with less defects

manual testing --> automated testing
build and deployment --> 

deployment --> automate
------------
1.0 --> running

download the new version
stop the sytem
remove old version
instal new version
start the system

DevOps and cloud two wheels for a bike
--------------------------------------


Server
---------
Windows vs Linux --> Linux
Super computers also use linux

everything is command here --> everything is text

Linux can run for years without restart
less power
less bandwidth
less memory
100% free
fast

We will start learning Linux

AWS account create --> free trail
500-1000rs per month
if more bill --> ask AWS they will refund
1Lakh --> please refund
