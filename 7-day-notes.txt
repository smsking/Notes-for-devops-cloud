NodeJS Structure
--------------------
.js files --> java script files
package.json -> developers mention the dependencies and thier version
				it is a build file
every language will have one build file
package.json --> nodejs
pom.xml --> java
requirements.txt --> python

install the dependencies --> npm install

49.204.198.60

NAT
2^32 total IP Address
IPV4 exhausted

mysql-server --> this is server
mysql --> client

Linux --> Server
Putty --> SSH client

facebook.com --> http server
browser --> http client

expense
ExpenseApp@1

these credentials are used by our nodejs application to connect

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS transactions;
USE transactions;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    amount INT,
    description VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'expense'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'ExpenseApp@1';
GRANT ALL ON transactions.* TO 'expense'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;



mysql -h 172.31.45.116 -uroot -pExpenseApp@1 < /app/schema/backend.sql

ping google.com

backend should be able to connect DB server on port no 3306

telnet <IP-Address> <port-no>

backend apps usually run on port no 8080

Nginx --> Engine-X
-----
http web server
reverse proxy
port no --> 80

/usr/share/nginx/html --> this is where we need to keep our frontend website

/etc/nginx --> Home directory of nginx

/etc/nginx/nginx.conf --> this is the nginx config file

/var/log/nginx/error.log --> this is the location nginx stores logs

/usr/share/nginx/html --> if you keep index.html. that will be served by default


proxy_http_version 1.1;

location /api/ { proxy_pass http://172.31.32.178:8080/; }

location /health {
  stub_status on;
  access_log off;
}


what is proxy?
-----------------
some one on behalf of you == proxy

VPN will change our location to US...

Forward Proxy
----------------
clients are aware of VPN, but servers are not aware

mobile is aware of VPN

company VPN
---------------
restrict the websites
monitor the user requests

Reverse Proxy
-----------------
clients are not aware of proxy/VPN, only servers are aware

SSL termination
